The prosecution highlights Tsarnaev's deliberate and calculated actions, including placing a bomb in a crowd of innocent civilians and showing a lack of remorse. The defense, however, is expected to argue that Tsarnaev was influenced by his older brother and was not fully responsible for his actions due to his age and lack of full brain development. The outcome of the trial is uncertain, but the jury is likely to vote for death despite the potential for a divided verdict.

The article had sparked a national conversation about sexual assault on college campuses, but it was widely criticized for its flawed reporting and lack of fact-checking. According to the article, UVA has never expelled a student for sexual assault, despite numerous allegations. However, an investigation by the law firm of O'Melveny & Myers found that the university failed to handle these allegations properly. The article also highlighted a culture on campus where sexual assault is normalized, with students using a euphemism for rape and judging victims based on their clothing. The retraction has raised concerns about whether survivors will come forward, fearing they will be accused of lying. The university has implemented a zero-tolerance policy on sexual assault, but it remains to be seen how effective this policy will be. The incident has sparked a wider debate about the need for better reporting and handling of sexual assault allegations on college campuses.", "response_spans": [[0, 508], [499, 1006], [992, 1106]], "scores": [{"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.6371420621871948, "(0, 16)": 0.6371420621871948, "(2, 0)": 0.6134335994720459, "(2, 16)": 0.6134335994720459, "(4, 0)": 0.6134335994720459, "(4, 16)": 0.6134335994720459, "(6, 0)": 0.6134335994720459, "(6, 16)": 0.9058191776275635, "(8, 0)": 0.6134335994720459, "(8, 16)": 0.6134335994720459, "(10, 0)": 0.6134335994720459, "(10, 16)": 0.6134335994720459, "(12, 0)": 0.6134335994720459, "(12, 16)": 0.9058191776275635, "(14, 0)": 0.6134335994720459, "(14, 16)": 0.6134335994720459, "(16, 0)": 0.6134335994720459, "(16, 16)": 0.6134335994720459, "(18, 0)": 0.6134335994720459, "(18, 16)": 0.9058191776275635, "(20, 0)": 0.9058191776275635, "(20, 16)": 0.6371420621871948, "(22, 0)": 0.6134335994720459, "(22, 16)": 0.9058191776275635, "(24, 0)": 0.6371420621871948, "(24, 16)": 0.9058191776275635, "(26, 0)": 0.6134335994720459, "(26, 16)": 0.6134335994720459, "(28, 0)": 0.6134335994720459, "(28, 16)": 0.6134335994720459, "(30, 0)": 0.6134335994720459, "(30, 16)": 0.6134335994720459}, "r_span": [1459, 1571], "hallucination_label": 1, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": -0.0012332797050476074}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.6990853548049927, "(0, 16)": 0.6990853548049927, "(2, 0)": 0.6990853548049927, "(2, 16)": 0.6990853548049927, "(4, 0)": 0.6990853548049927, "(4, 16)": 0.5785055160522461, "(6, 0)": 0.5785055160522461, "(6, 16)": 0.7418818473815918, "(8, 0)": 0.6990853548049927, "(8, 16)": 0.6990853548049927, "(10, 0)": 0.5785055160522461, "(10, 16)": 0.5785055160522461, "(12, 0)": 0.5785055160522461, "(12, 16)": 0.7418818473815918, "(14, 0)": 0.6990853548049927, "(14, 16)": 0.5785055160522461, "(16, 0)": 0.5785055160522461, "(16, 16)": 0.6990853548049927, "(18, 0)": 0.5785055160522461, "(18, 16)": 0.7418818473815918, "(20, 0)": 0.6990853548049927, "(20, 16)": 0.6990853548049927, "(22, 0)": 0.6990853548049927, "(22, 16)": 0.6990853548049927, "(24, 0)": 0.6990853548049927, "(24, 16)": 0.7239893674850464, "(26, 0)": 0.7342573404312134, "(26, 16)": 0.5785055160522461, "(28, 0)": 0.5785055160522461, "(28, 16)": 0.6990853548049927, "(30, 0)": 0.7342573404312134, "(30, 16)": 0.7342573404312134}, "r_span": [1570, 1675], "hallucination_label": 1, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.0017367005348205566}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.6190465688705444, "(0, 16)": 0.6190465688705444, "(2, 0)": 0.6190465688705444, "(2, 16)": 0.7373178005218506, "(4, 0)": 0.5834406614303589, "(4, 16)": 0.5834406614303589, "(6, 0)": 0.5834406614303589, "(6, 16)": 0.6923804879188538, "(8, 0)": 0.6190465688705444, "(8, 16)": 0.6190465688705444, "(10, 0)": 0.5834406614303589, "(10, 16)": 0.5834406614303589, "(12, 0)": 0.5834406614303589, "(12, 16)": 0.7373178005218506, "(14, 0)": 0.6190465688705444, "(14, 16)": 0.5834406614303589, "(16, 0)": 0.5834406614303589, "(16, 16)": 0.5834406614303589, "(18, 0)": 0.7023550271987915, "(18, 16)": 0.6190465688705444, "(20, 0)": 0.7373178005218506, "(20, 16)": 0.6190465688705444, "(22, 0)": 0.6190465688705444, "(22, 16)": 0.6190465688705444, "(24, 0)": 0.6190465688705444, "(24, 16)": 0.7373178005218506, "(26, 0)": 0.6853132843971252, "(26, 16)": 0.5834406614303589, "(28, 0)": 0.5834406614303589, "(28, 16)": 0.6190465688705444, "(30, 0)": 0.6853132843971252, "(30, 16)": 0.6853132843971252}, "r_span": [1673, 1693], "hallucination_label": 1, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": -0.00016319751739501953}}]}, {"id": "927", "source_id": "15747", "model": "llama-2-7b-chat", "temperature": 0.775, "labels": [{"start": 705, "end": 858, "text": "Additionally, Jiang shares insights on the impact of sleep deprivation on IQ, the benefits of doing nothing, and the habits of highly ineffective people.", "meta": "EVIDENT CONFLICT\nOriginal: The information were not shared by Jia Jiang.\nGenerative: \"Jiang shares insights on the impact of sleep... habits of highly ineffective people.\"", "label_type": "Evident Conflict", "implicit_true": false, "due_to_null": false}], "split": "test", "quality": "good", "response": "Jia Jiang, a Chinese-born entrepreneur, faced rejection when he quit his comfortable job to pursue his dreams of becoming an entrepreneur.

The author suggests that deeper changes are needed, such as tougher employment screening standards, more training for officers, and broader social changes to address income, education, and opportunity disparities between races. The article concludes that while body cameras cannot eradicate racial bias, they can help bring it to light and prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.", "response_spans": [[0, 511], [502, 818]], "scores": [{"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.7619974613189697, "(0, 16)": 0.7619974613189697, "(2, 0)": 0.6801474094390869, "(2, 16)": 0.7619974613189697, "(4, 0)": 0.7619974613189697, "(4, 16)": 0.7619974613189697, "(6, 0)": 0.7619974613189697, "(6, 16)": 0.7500669956207275, "(8, 0)": 0.7619974613189697, "(8, 16)": 0.7619974613189697, "(10, 0)": 0.7619974613189697, "(10, 16)": 0.7619974613189697, "(12, 0)": 0.7619974613189697, "(12, 16)": 0.7727525234222412, "(14, 0)": 0.7619974613189697, "(14, 16)": 0.7557689547538757, "(16, 0)": 0.7557689547538757, "(16, 16)": 0.7619974613189697, "(18, 0)": 0.7619974613189697, "(18, 16)": 0.7727525234222412, "(20, 0)": 0.7727525234222412, "(20, 16)": 0.7389855980873108, "(22, 0)": 0.7557689547538757, "(22, 16)": 0.7557689547538757, "(24, 0)": 0.7389855980873108, "(24, 16)": 0.7557689547538757, "(26, 0)": 0.7557689547538757, "(26, 16)": 0.7557689547538757, "(28, 0)": 0.7557689547538757, "(28, 16)": 0.7389855980873108, "(30, 0)": 0.7557689547538757, "(30, 16)": 0.7557689547538757}, "r_span": [1044, 1146], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.0002224445343017578}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.7754313945770264, "(0, 16)": 0.8812716007232666, "(2, 0)": 0.8812716007232666, "(2, 16)": 0.8812716007232666, "(4, 0)": 0.8812716007232666, "(4, 16)": 0.8812716007232666, "(6, 0)": 0.8812716007232666, "(6, 16)": 0.690682590007782, "(8, 0)": 0.8812716007232666, "(8, 16)": 0.8812716007232666, "(10, 0)": 0.8812716007232666, "(10, 16)": 0.8812716007232666, "(12, 0)": 0.8812716007232666, "(12, 16)": 0.7754313945770264, "(14, 0)": 0.8812716007232666, "(14, 16)": 0.8812716007232666, "(16, 0)": 0.8812716007232666, "(16, 16)": 0.8812716007232666, "(18, 0)": 0.7080956697463989, "(18, 16)": 0.7754313945770264, "(20, 0)": 0.8812716007232666, "(20, 16)": 0.8812716007232666, "(22, 0)": 0.579298734664917, "(22, 16)": 0.8812716007232666, "(24, 0)": 0.7080956697463989, "(24, 16)": 0.8812716007232666, "(26, 0)": 0.579298734664917, "(26, 16)": 0.8812716007232666, "(28, 0)": 0.579298734664917, "(28, 16)": 0.8812716007232666, "(30, 0)": 0.7080956697463989, "(30, 16)": 0.579298734664917}, "r_span": [1145, 1208], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.0009717345237731934}}]}, {"id": "1053", "source_id": "15769", "model": "llama-2-7b-chat", "temperature": 0.925, "labels": [], "split": "test", "quality": "good", "response": "Here is a summary of the article in 99 words:\n\nTomasz Lazar, a Polish photographer, has been interviewing and photographing adults who were forced to live in Siberia as children during World War II.

Obama shared his personal experience with air quality in Los Angeles, stating that it was bad enough in the 1970s that he couldn't go outside during smog alerts. He highlighted the progress made since then due to the Clean Air Act and stressed the importance of taking action to improve air quality. Murphy discussed the impact of climate change on his family, citing his father's battle with asthma, and emphasized the need for communities to prepare for and respond to the health effects of climate change. The event also featured a roundtable discussion with doctors and nurses who are working to raise awareness and develop strategies to address the health effects of climate change. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), climate change will lead to increased heat exposure, malnutrition, and the spread of disease-carrying insects, and is expected to cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050. Despite this, there remains a sizable group of people who deny that climate change is occurring.", "response_spans": [[0, 512], [493, 998], [979, 1416]], "scores": [{"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.6061538457870483, "(0, 16)": 0.6021311283111572, "(2, 0)": 0.6061538457870483, "(2, 16)": 0.6061538457870483, "(4, 0)": 0.6061538457870483, "(4, 16)": 0.6061538457870483, "(6, 0)": 0.6061538457870483, "(6, 16)": 0.8668467998504639, "(8, 0)": 0.6061538457870483, "(8, 16)": 0.6061538457870483, "(10, 0)": 0.6061538457870483, "(10, 16)": 0.6061538457870483, "(12, 0)": 0.6061538457870483, "(12, 16)": 0.8668467998504639, "(14, 0)": 0.6061538457870483, "(14, 16)": 0.6061538457870483, "(16, 0)": 0.6061538457870483, "(16, 16)": 0.6061538457870483, "(18, 0)": 0.6061538457870483, "(18, 16)": 0.8668467998504639, "(20, 0)": 0.8668467998504639, "(20, 16)": 0.6061538457870483, "(22, 0)": 0.6061538457870483, "(22, 16)": 0.6797446608543396, "(24, 0)": 0.6061538457870483, "(24, 16)": 0.8668467998504639, "(26, 0)": 0.6061538457870483, "(26, 16)": 0.6061538457870483, "(28, 0)": 0.6061538457870483, "(28, 16)": 0.6061538457870483, "(30, 0)": 0.6061538457870483, "(30, 16)": 0.6061538457870483}, "r_span": [1414, 1529], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.0015256404876708984}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.7359839081764221, "(0, 16)": 0.6165552139282227, "(2, 0)": 0.7359839081764221, "(2, 16)": 0.7359839081764221, "(4, 0)": 0.7359839081764221, "(4, 16)": 0.7359839081764221, "(6, 0)": 0.7359839081764221, "(6, 16)": 0.5809534788131714, "(8, 0)": 0.7359839081764221, "(8, 16)": 0.7359839081764221, "(10, 0)": 0.7359839081764221, "(10, 16)": 0.7359839081764221, "(12, 0)": 0.7359839081764221, "(12, 16)": 0.7217113971710205, "(14, 0)": 0.7359839081764221, "(14, 16)": 0.7359839081764221, "(16, 0)": 0.7359839081764221, "(16, 16)": 0.7359839081764221, "(18, 0)": 0.7359839081764221, "(18, 16)": 0.7542380094528198, "(20, 0)": 0.7217113971710205, "(20, 16)": 0.6165552139282227, "(22, 0)": 0.6165552139282227, "(22, 16)": 0.7217113971710205, "(24, 0)": 0.7359839081764221, "(24, 16)": 0.7217113971710205, "(26, 0)": 0.6165552139282227, "(26, 16)": 0.7359839081764221, "(28, 0)": 0.7359839081764221, "(28, 16)": 0.6165552139282227, "(30, 0)": 0.7359839081764221, "(30, 16)": 0.7359839081764221}, "r_span": [1524, 1632], "hallucination_label": 1, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": -0.0007800459861755371}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.5500604510307312, "(0, 16)": 0.5500604510307312, "(2, 0)": 0.5500604510307312, "(2, 16)": 0.5500604510307312, "(4, 0)": 0.5500604510307312, "(4, 16)": 0.5500604510307312, "(6, 0)": 0.5500604510307312, "(6, 16)": 0.835747241973877, "(8, 0)": 0.5500604510307312, "(8, 16)": 0.5500604510307312, "(10, 0)": 0.5500604510307312, "(10, 16)": 0.5500604510307312, "(12, 0)": 0.5500604510307312, "(12, 16)": 0.835747241973877, "(14, 0)": 0.5500604510307312, "(14, 16)": 0.5500604510307312, "(16, 0)": 0.5500604510307312, "(16, 16)": 0.5500604510307312, "(18, 0)": 0.5500604510307312, "(18, 16)": 0.6410887837409973, "(20, 0)": 0.835747241973877, "(20, 16)": 0.6410887837409973, "(22, 0)": 0.5500604510307312, "(22, 16)": 0.6410887837409973, "(24, 0)": 0.5500604510307312, "(24, 16)": 0.6410887837409973, "(26, 0)": 0.5500604510307312, "(26, 16)": 0.5500604510307312, "(28, 0)": 0.5500604510307312, "(28, 16)": 0.5500604510307312, "(30, 0)": 0.5500604510307312, "(30, 16)": 0.5500604510307312}, "r_span": [1628, 1736], "hallucination_label": 1, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.0007236599922180176}}]}, {"id": "1239", "source_id": "15800", "model": "llama-2-7b-chat", "temperature": 1.0, "labels": [{"start": 166, "end": 215, "text": "the bike was recovered by police just days later,", "meta": "HIGH INTRO OF NEW INFO\nOriginal: No mention of how many hours or days the police retrieve the bike\nGenerative: \"...the bike was recovered by police just days later...\"", "label_type": "Evident Baseless Info", "implicit_true": false, "due_to_null": false}], "split": "test", "quality": "good", "response": "Cyclist Wang Pingan's epic 460-day trip across China came to an abrupt halt when his beloved bike was stolen in the city of Shenzhen.

However, the journey is fraught with danger, including kidnapping, robbery, and capsizing of boats. Despite these risks, many migrants see it as their only option for a better life in Europe. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has tracked the migration flows through North Africa for years and notes that the \"push factor\" of instability and poverty in Africa and the Middle East is greater than the \"pull factor\" of Europe.

Former NASA scientist James Hansen has warned that continued opposition to nuclear power could threaten efforts to avoid dangerous climate change. However, the administration's energy policy plan appears to be biased against nuclear energy, as demonstrated by its modeled emissions reductions scenarios, which assume no new nuclear construction and the retirement of nearly all operating plants by 2050. This is despite the fact that nuclear power is carbon-free and could play a crucial role in meeting aggressive carbon reduction targets. The administration's recent executive order on federal sustainability does not provide enough credit for emission reductions from nuclear energy, and its modeling seems to encourage the shutdown of existing nuclear plants in favor of natural gas combined cycle plants. Critics argue that this reflects a broader anti-nuclear bias in the administration's policies, despite its claims to support an all-of-the-above energy strategy and addressing climate change.", "response_spans": [[0, 512], [496, 1006], [988, 1165]], "scores": [{"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.763788640499115, "(0, 16)": 0.763788640499115, "(2, 0)": 0.763788640499115, "(2, 16)": 0.763788640499115, "(4, 0)": 0.763788640499115, "(4, 16)": 0.763788640499115, "(6, 0)": 0.763788640499115, "(6, 16)": 0.8315096497535706, "(8, 0)": 0.763788640499115, "(8, 16)": 0.763788640499115, "(10, 0)": 0.8315096497535706, "(10, 16)": 0.763788640499115, "(12, 0)": 0.763788640499115, "(12, 16)": 0.8315096497535706, "(14, 0)": 0.763788640499115, "(14, 16)": 0.8559784293174744, "(16, 0)": 0.8559784293174744, "(16, 16)": 0.763788640499115, "(18, 0)": 0.763788640499115, "(18, 16)": 0.8315096497535706, "(20, 0)": 0.8559784293174744, "(20, 16)": 0.763788640499115, "(22, 0)": 0.8340470790863037, "(22, 16)": 0.8315096497535706, "(24, 0)": 0.8340470790863037, "(24, 16)": 0.8315096497535706, "(26, 0)": 0.8559784293174744, "(26, 16)": 0.7363291382789612, "(28, 0)": 0.8559784293174744, "(28, 16)": 0.763788640499115, "(30, 0)": 0.8559784293174744, "(30, 16)": 0.8559784293174744}, "r_span": [1180, 1278], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.0021382570266723633}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.7514649033546448, "(0, 16)": 0.7514649033546448, "(2, 0)": 0.7514649033546448, "(2, 16)": 0.7514649033546448, "(4, 0)": 0.7514649033546448, "(4, 16)": 0.7514649033546448, "(6, 0)": 0.7514649033546448, "(6, 16)": 0.718113124370575, "(8, 0)": 0.7514649033546448, "(8, 16)": 0.7514649033546448, "(10, 0)": 0.7514649033546448, "(10, 16)": 0.7514649033546448, "(12, 0)": 0.7514649033546448, "(12, 16)": 0.8494102954864502, "(14, 0)": 0.7514649033546448, "(14, 16)": 0.7514649033546448, "(16, 0)": 0.7514649033546448, "(16, 16)": 0.7514649033546448, "(18, 0)": 0.8494102954864502, "(18, 16)": 0.8494102954864502, "(20, 0)": 0.8494102954864502, "(20, 16)": 0.7514649033546448, "(22, 0)": 0.8494102954864502, "(22, 16)": 0.8494102954864502, "(24, 0)": 0.7514649033546448, "(24, 16)": 0.8494102954864502, "(26, 0)": 0.7742058038711548, "(26, 16)": 0.7514649033546448, "(28, 0)": 0.7742058038711548, "(28, 16)": 0.7514649033546448, "(30, 0)": 0.8494102954864502, "(30, 16)": 0.7742058038711548}, "r_span": [1277, 1377], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": -0.0013781189918518066}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.699159562587738, "(0, 16)": 0.699159562587738, "(2, 0)": 0.699159562587738, "(2, 16)": 0.6972690224647522, "(4, 0)": 0.699159562587738, "(4, 16)": 0.699159562587738, "(6, 0)": 0.699159562587738, "(6, 16)": 0.699159562587738, "(8, 0)": 0.699159562587738, "(8, 16)": 0.699159562587738, "(10, 0)": 0.699159562587738, "(10, 16)": 0.699159562587738, "(12, 0)": 0.699159562587738, "(12, 16)": 0.699159562587738, "(14, 0)": 0.6972690224647522, "(14, 16)": 0.699159562587738, "(16, 0)": 0.699159562587738, "(16, 16)": 0.6972690224647522, "(18, 0)": 0.6972690224647522, "(18, 16)": 0.699159562587738, "(20, 0)": 0.699159562587738, "(20, 16)": 0.699159562587738, "(22, 0)": 0.6398385763168335, "(22, 16)": 0.699159562587738, "(24, 0)": 0.699159562587738, "(24, 16)": 0.699159562587738, "(26, 0)": 0.6398385763168335, "(26, 16)": 0.699159562587738, "(28, 0)": 0.6398385763168335, "(28, 16)": 0.699159562587738, "(30, 0)": 0.6972690224647522, "(30, 16)": 0.6398385763168335}, "r_span": [1374, 1414], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.000946342945098877}}]}, {"id": "1455", "source_id": "15836", "model": "llama-2-7b-chat", "temperature": 1.0, "labels": [], "split": "test", "quality": "good", "response": "On the 100th anniversary of the massacre of Armenians under the Ottoman Empire, Turkey remains steadfast in its refusal to acknowledge the event as genocide.

Meanwhile, many Turks remain unaware or uncomfortable with the topic, and the issue continues to divide opinions both within Turkey and internationally.", "response_spans": [[0, 509], [491, 740]], "scores": [{"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.715978741645813, "(0, 16)": 0.6135420799255371, "(2, 0)": 0.715978741645813, "(2, 16)": 0.715978741645813, "(4, 0)": 0.715978741645813, "(4, 16)": 0.715978741645813, "(6, 0)": 0.715978741645813, "(6, 16)": 0.8218894600868225, "(8, 0)": 0.715978741645813, "(8, 16)": 0.715978741645813, "(10, 0)": 0.715978741645813, "(10, 16)": 0.715978741645813, "(12, 0)": 0.715978741645813, "(12, 16)": 0.8218894600868225, "(14, 0)": 0.715978741645813, "(14, 16)": 0.715978741645813, "(16, 0)": 0.715978741645813, "(16, 16)": 0.715978741645813, "(18, 0)": 0.715978741645813, "(18, 16)": 0.8218894600868225, "(20, 0)": 0.8218894600868225, "(20, 16)": 0.715978741645813, "(22, 0)": 0.715978741645813, "(22, 16)": 0.715978741645813, "(24, 0)": 0.715978741645813, "(24, 16)": 0.8218894600868225, "(26, 0)": 0.715978741645813, "(26, 16)": 0.715978741645813, "(28, 0)": 0.715978741645813, "(28, 16)": 0.715978741645813, "(30, 0)": 0.715978741645813, "(30, 16)": 0.715978741645813}, "r_span": [1468, 1588], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.00010287761688232422}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.6899155378341675, "(0, 16)": 0.6899155378341675, "(2, 0)": 0.7235047817230225, "(2, 16)": 0.7235047817230225, "(4, 0)": 0.7235047817230225, "(4, 16)": 0.7235047817230225, "(6, 0)": 0.7235047817230225, "(6, 16)": 0.6591942310333252, "(8, 0)": 0.7235047817230225, "(8, 16)": 0.7235047817230225, "(10, 0)": 0.6899155378341675, "(10, 16)": 0.6899155378341675, "(12, 0)": 0.7235047817230225, "(12, 16)": 0.7073301076889038, "(14, 0)": 0.7235047817230225, "(14, 16)": 0.6899155378341675, "(16, 0)": 0.6899155378341675, "(16, 16)": 0.7235047817230225, "(18, 0)": 0.7235047817230225, "(18, 16)": 0.6469216346740723, "(20, 0)": 0.7073301076889038, "(20, 16)": 0.6899155378341675, "(22, 0)": 0.6899155378341675, "(22, 16)": 0.7073301076889038, "(24, 0)": 0.7235047817230225, "(24, 16)": 0.7073301076889038, "(26, 0)": 0.6899155378341675, "(26, 16)": 0.6899155378341675, "(28, 0)": 0.6899155378341675, "(28, 16)": 0.7235047817230225, "(30, 0)": 0.6899155378341675, "(30, 16)": 0.7235047817230225}, "r_span": [1586, 1637], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": -0.0017229914665222168}}]}, {"id": "1479", "source_id": "11317", "model": "llama-2-7b-chat", "temperature": 1.0, "labels": [], "split": "test", "quality": "good", "response": "Walmart, one of the largest employers in the United States, has emerged as a key player in the national debate on religious freedom laws and LGBTQ rights.

If Obama can articulate a clear vision and demonstrate support for democracy, human rights, and the rule of law in the region, he may be able to rebuild US relationships and improve the lives of millions of people living in poverty.", "response_spans": [[0, 510], [496, 1005], [989, 1068]], "scores": [{"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.6929459571838379, "(0, 16)": 0.6929459571838379, "(2, 0)": 0.6929459571838379, "(2, 16)": 0.6929459571838379, "(4, 0)": 0.6929459571838379, "(4, 16)": 0.6929459571838379, "(6, 0)": 0.6929459571838379, "(6, 16)": 0.7532005310058594, "(8, 0)": 0.6929459571838379, "(8, 16)": 0.6929459571838379, "(10, 0)": 0.736282467842102, "(10, 16)": 0.6929459571838379, "(12, 0)": 0.6929459571838379, "(12, 16)": 0.8174054622650146, "(14, 0)": 0.7364411950111389, "(14, 16)": 0.7999023199081421, "(16, 0)": 0.7999023199081421, "(16, 16)": 0.7364411950111389, "(18, 0)": 0.7364411950111389, "(18, 16)": 0.8174054622650146, "(20, 0)": 0.7239896059036255, "(20, 16)": 0.7364411950111389, "(22, 0)": 0.7364411950111389, "(22, 16)": 0.6609610319137573, "(24, 0)": 0.7364411950111389, "(24, 16)": 0.8174054622650146, "(26, 0)": 0.7999023199081421, "(26, 16)": 0.736282467842102, "(28, 0)": 0.7999023199081421, "(28, 16)": 0.7364411950111389, "(30, 0)": 0.7999023199081421, "(30, 16)": 0.7999023199081421}, "r_span": [1422, 1534], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.0017426013946533203}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.766665518283844, "(0, 16)": 0.766665518283844, "(2, 0)": 0.766665518283844, "(2, 16)": 0.766665518283844, "(4, 0)": 0.766665518283844, "(4, 16)": 0.766665518283844, "(6, 0)": 0.766665518283844, "(6, 16)": 0.7121517062187195, "(8, 0)": 0.766665518283844, "(8, 16)": 0.7675994634628296, "(10, 0)": 0.7747868299484253, "(10, 16)": 0.766665518283844, "(12, 0)": 0.7675994634628296, "(12, 16)": 0.7747868299484253, "(14, 0)": 0.7675994634628296, "(14, 16)": 0.766665518283844, "(16, 0)": 0.7675994634628296, "(16, 16)": 0.766665518283844, "(18, 0)": 0.7675994634628296, "(18, 16)": 0.7675994634628296, "(20, 0)": 0.7675994634628296, "(20, 16)": 0.7675994634628296, "(22, 0)": 0.7675994634628296, "(22, 16)": 0.7675994634628296, "(24, 0)": 0.7675994634628296, "(24, 16)": 0.7675994634628296, "(26, 0)": 0.7036072015762329, "(26, 16)": 0.7675994634628296, "(28, 0)": 0.7036072015762329, "(28, 16)": 0.7675994634628296, "(30, 0)": 0.7036072015762329, "(30, 16)": 0.7036072015762329}, "r_span": [1532, 1644], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": -0.00034046173095703125}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.6402357816696167, "(0, 16)": 0.6402357816696167, "(2, 0)": 0.6402357816696167, "(2, 16)": 0.5347251296043396, "(4, 0)": 0.6402357816696167, "(4, 16)": 0.5347251296043396, "(6, 0)": 0.6402357816696167, "(6, 16)": 0.5851413011550903, "(8, 0)": 0.6402357816696167, "(8, 16)": 0.5137310028076172, "(10, 0)": 0.6402357816696167, "(10, 16)": 0.6402357816696167, "(12, 0)": 0.5347251296043396, "(12, 16)": 0.6402357816696167, "(14, 0)": 0.5347251296043396, "(14, 16)": 0.6402357816696167, "(16, 0)": 0.6402357816696167, "(16, 16)": 0.5347251296043396, "(18, 0)": 0.5347251296043396, "(18, 16)": 0.6402357816696167, "(20, 0)": 0.6402357816696167, "(20, 16)": 0.5347251296043396, "(22, 0)": 0.5347251296043396, "(22, 16)": 0.6402357816696167, "(24, 0)": 0.5347251296043396, "(24, 16)": 0.6402357816696167, "(26, 0)": 0.5391534566879272, "(26, 16)": 0.5347251296043396, "(28, 0)": 0.5391534566879272, "(28, 16)": 0.5347251296043396, "(30, 0)": 0.5347251296043396, "(30, 16)": 0.5391534566879272}, "r_span": [1643, 1657], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.0001170039176940918}}]}, {"id": "1677", "source_id": "11383", "model": "llama-2-7b-chat", "temperature": 1.0, "labels": [], "split": "test", "quality": "good", "response": "Here is a summary of the article in 106 words:\n\nUnicef delivered vital food and supplies to Yemen despite the ongoing conflict between Houthi rebels and Saudi-led coalition forces.

In 1980, the acquittal of police officers involved in the beating death of Arthur McDuffie led to widespread protests and violence in Miami. Similar incidents, such as the death of Freddie Gray in police custody in Baltimore, have led to riots and protests in recent years. The author notes that while riots may seem senseless and destructive, they can also be a powerful tool for bringing about change. She highlights the importance of nonviolent civil disobedience and legislative channels in advancing the civil rights agenda. The author also emphasizes the need for government officials to take action to address the underlying issues that lead to riots, such as poverty, joblessness, and racial bias in the criminal justice system. By examining the root causes of these conflicts, the author suggests, we can work towards creating a more just and equitable society.", "response_spans": [[0, 511], [493, 986]], "scores": [{"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.603702962398529, "(0, 16)": 0.603702962398529, "(2, 0)": 0.603702962398529, "(2, 16)": 0.603702962398529, "(4, 0)": 0.603702962398529, "(4, 16)": 0.603702962398529, "(6, 0)": 0.603702962398529, "(6, 16)": 0.844086766242981, "(8, 0)": 0.603702962398529, "(8, 16)": 0.603702962398529, "(10, 0)": 0.603702962398529, "(10, 16)": 0.603702962398529, "(12, 0)": 0.603702962398529, "(12, 16)": 0.844086766242981, "(14, 0)": 0.603702962398529, "(14, 16)": 0.603702962398529, "(16, 0)": 0.603702962398529, "(16, 16)": 0.603702962398529, "(18, 0)": 0.603702962398529, "(18, 16)": 0.844086766242981, "(20, 0)": 0.844086766242981, "(20, 16)": 0.603702962398529, "(22, 0)": 0.603702962398529, "(22, 16)": 0.603702962398529, "(24, 0)": 0.603702962398529, "(24, 16)": 0.7600135803222656, "(26, 0)": 0.603702962398529, "(26, 16)": 0.603702962398529, "(28, 0)": 0.603702962398529, "(28, 16)": 0.603702962398529, "(30, 0)": 0.603702962398529, "(30, 16)": 0.603702962398529}, "r_span": [1461, 1584], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.005572676658630371}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.6640978455543518, "(0, 16)": 0.644651472568512, "(2, 0)": 0.6640978455543518, "(2, 16)": 0.6640978455543518, "(4, 0)": 0.6640978455543518, "(4, 16)": 0.6640978455543518, "(6, 0)": 0.6640978455543518, "(6, 16)": 0.7027135491371155, "(8, 0)": 0.6640978455543518, "(8, 16)": 0.6640978455543518, "(10, 0)": 0.644651472568512, "(10, 16)": 0.6640978455543518, "(12, 0)": 0.6640978455543518, "(12, 16)": 0.6572421193122864, "(14, 0)": 0.6640978455543518, "(14, 16)": 0.6640978455543518, "(16, 0)": 0.6640978455543518, "(16, 16)": 0.6640978455543518, "(18, 0)": 0.6640978455543518, "(18, 16)": 0.7484055757522583, "(20, 0)": 0.7202330827713013, "(20, 16)": 0.644651472568512, "(22, 0)": 0.6640978455543518, "(22, 16)": 0.7264031767845154, "(24, 0)": 0.6640978455543518, "(24, 16)": 0.7202330827713013, "(26, 0)": 0.644651472568512, "(26, 16)": 0.6640978455543518, "(28, 0)": 0.644651472568512, "(28, 16)": 0.644651472568512, "(30, 0)": 0.6640978455543518, "(30, 16)": 0.6640978455543518}, "r_span": [1582, 1684], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": -0.0008481144905090332}}]}, {"id": "2247", "source_id": "11839", "model": "llama-2-7b-chat", "temperature": 1.0, "labels": [{"start": 169, "end": 203, "text": "Four alleged attackers were killed", "meta": "EVIDENT CONFLICT\nAIGC: Four alleged attackers were killed\nOriginal: Three of the alleged attackers were killed,", "label_type": "Evident Conflict", "implicit_true": false, "due_to_null": false}], "split": "test", "quality": "good", "response": "Here is a summary of the news in 38 words:\n\nIsraeli jets struck targets in the occupied Golan Heights after militants attempted to plant a bomb near the Israeli border.

Clinton also pledged to work towards ensuring that 100% of the population is paid 100% of what they are worth. This announcement comes on Equal Pay Day, which is calculated based on the fact that women would have to work until April 14th, 2015 to earn the same amount of money as men earned in 2014. According to the article, closing the gender wage gap would pull half of working single moms out of poverty and put money in the pockets of working people who would actually stimulate economic growth.

The bar has a rating of 2.5 stars and has received mixed reviews from customers.\n\nSome customers have praised the bar for its friendly staff, great margaritas, and abundance of TVs showing various sporting events. One reviewer noted that the bar feels like a \"neighborhood bar located at ground zero of tourist central,\" suggesting that it may not be the best option for those looking for a more upscale experience.\n\nHowever, other customers have had negative experiences at the bar. One reviewer reported being given a hard time by the bouncers upon entering the bar, while another described being overcharged for drinks. A third reviewer noted that the bar's atmosphere is not typically what they expect from a Santa Barbara establishment, preferring a more \"upscale\" vibe.\n\nOverall, O'Malleys Bar seems to be a hit

The restaurant has been renovated since its previous incarnation as Cabo's, with updates to the interior and bathrooms. However, the quality of the food has taken a hit, with reports of overcooked or raw food, high prices, and poorly mixed drinks. The restaurant has a casual atmosphere, with both indoor and outdoor seating, but the food does not seem to live up to the expectations of former patrons of Cabo's. While the service is generally good, the kitchen seems to be struggling to meet the standards of the restaurant's previous era. Overall, while the ambiance may be improved, the food at Cabo's Baja Grill & Cantina is underwhelming and may not be worth a visit for those who remember the quality of the food at its previous location.", "response_spans": [[0, 100], [102, 612], [595, 934]], "scores": [{"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.48587968945503235, "(0, 16)": 0.48587968945503235, "(2, 0)": 0.535602331161499, "(2, 16)": 0.48587968945503235, "(4, 0)": 0.48587968945503235, "(4, 16)": 0.543939471244812, "(6, 0)": 0.48587968945503235, "(6, 16)": 0.6840548515319824, "(8, 0)": 0.48587968945503235, "(8, 16)": 0.48587968945503235, "(10, 0)": 0.6300472021102905, "(10, 16)": 0.48587968945503235, "(12, 0)": 0.48587968945503235, "(12, 16)": 0.6300472021102905, "(14, 0)": 0.48587968945503235, "(14, 16)": 0.6300472021102905, "(16, 0)": 0.6300472021102905, "(16, 16)": 0.48587968945503235, "(18, 0)": 0.48587968945503235, "(18, 16)": 0.6300472021102905, "(20, 0)": 0.6300472021102905, "(20, 16)": 0.48587968945503235, "(22, 0)": 0.543939471244812, "(22, 16)": 0.6300472021102905, "(24, 0)": 0.543939471244812, "(24, 16)": 0.6300472021102905, "(26, 0)": 0.6300472021102905, "(26, 16)": 0.6300472021102905, "(28, 0)": 0.5330892205238342, "(28, 16)": 0.48587968945503235, "(30, 0)": 0.6300472021102905, "(30, 16)": 0.6300472021102905}, "r_span": [1428, 1456], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.000844419002532959}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.6065542101860046, "(0, 16)": 0.6065542101860046, "(2, 0)": 0.6065542101860046, "(2, 16)": 0.6065542101860046, "(4, 0)": 0.6065542101860046, "(4, 16)": 0.6065542101860046, "(6, 0)": 0.6065542101860046, "(6, 16)": 0.7106270790100098, "(8, 0)": 0.6155433654785156, "(8, 16)": 0.6065542101860046, "(10, 0)": 0.6352519392967224, "(10, 16)": 0.6065542101860046, "(12, 0)": 0.6065542101860046, "(12, 16)": 0.7106270790100098, "(14, 0)": 0.6065542101860046, "(14, 16)": 0.6065542101860046, "(16, 0)": 0.7106270790100098, "(16, 16)": 0.6065542101860046, "(18, 0)": 0.6065542101860046, "(18, 16)": 0.7106270790100098, "(20, 0)": 0.7106270790100098, "(20, 16)": 0.6065542101860046, "(22, 0)": 0.4039226770401001, "(22, 16)": 0.7106270790100098, "(24, 0)": 0.6338452100753784, "(24, 16)": 0.7106270790100098, "(26, 0)": 0.4039226770401001, "(26, 16)": 0.6338452100753784, "(28, 0)": 0.4039226770401001, "(28, 16)": 0.6065542101860046, "(30, 0)": 0.4039226770401001, "(30, 16)": 0.4039226770401001}, "r_span": [1458, 1585], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.0032671689987182617}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.6413424611091614, "(0, 16)": 0.7022291421890259, "(2, 0)": 0.7022291421890259, "(2, 16)": 0.6413424611091614, "(4, 0)": 0.7022291421890259, "(4, 16)": 0.7022291421890259, "(6, 0)": 0.7022291421890259, "(6, 16)": 0.7967753410339355, "(8, 0)": 0.7022291421890259, "(8, 16)": 0.6413424611091614, "(10, 0)": 0.7022291421890259, "(10, 16)": 0.7022291421890259, "(12, 0)": 0.7022291421890259, "(12, 16)": 0.7022291421890259, "(14, 0)": 0.7022291421890259, "(14, 16)": 0.47069668769836426, "(16, 0)": 0.7022291421890259, "(16, 16)": 0.7022291421890259, "(18, 0)": 0.6413424611091614, "(18, 16)": 0.7022291421890259, "(20, 0)": 0.7022291421890259, "(20, 16)": 0.7022291421890259, "(22, 0)": 0.472858190536499, "(22, 16)": 0.7022291421890259, "(24, 0)": 0.7341802716255188, "(24, 16)": 0.7967753410339355, "(26, 0)": 0.472858190536499, "(26, 16)": 0.7341802716255188, "(28, 0)": 0.472858190536499, "(28, 16)": 0.7022291421890259, "(30, 0)": 0.472858190536499, "(30, 16)": 0.472858190536499}, "r_span": [1579, 1659], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": -0.0004799365997314453}}]}, {"id": "8787", "source_id": "14552", "model": "llama-2-7b-chat", "temperature": 0.7, "labels": [{"start": 559, "end": 572, "text": "casual dining", "meta": "Conflict: Business Info tagged this as \" false\" therefore this is not available in the establishment.", "label_type": "Evident Conflict", "implicit_true": false, "due_to_null": false}], "split": "test", "quality": "good", "response": "Verde is a Spanish, tapas, and Mexican restaurant located in Santa Barbara, California.

Overall, Sandpiper Grill appears to offer decent food and drinks, but may benefit from improved service and efficiency.", "response_spans": [[0, 88], [90, 600], [581, 756]], "scores": [{"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.4656367897987366, "(0, 16)": 0.4656367897987366, "(2, 0)": 0.4656367897987366, "(2, 16)": 0.4656367897987366, "(4, 0)": 0.4656367897987366, "(4, 16)": 0.4656367897987366, "(6, 0)": 0.4656367897987366, "(6, 16)": 0.6224139332771301, "(8, 0)": 0.4656367897987366, "(8, 16)": 0.4656367897987366, "(10, 0)": 0.6224139332771301, "(10, 16)": 0.6224139332771301, "(12, 0)": 0.4656367897987366, "(12, 16)": 0.6224139332771301, "(14, 0)": 0.4656367897987366, "(14, 16)": 0.6224139332771301, "(16, 0)": 0.6224139332771301, "(16, 16)": 0.5544383525848389, "(18, 0)": 0.4656367897987366, "(18, 16)": 0.6224139332771301, "(20, 0)": 0.6224139332771301, "(20, 16)": 0.4478541910648346, "(22, 0)": 0.6224139332771301, "(22, 16)": 0.6224139332771301, "(24, 0)": 0.4478541910648346, "(24, 16)": 0.6224139332771301, "(26, 0)": 0.6224139332771301, "(26, 16)": 0.510308563709259, "(28, 0)": 0.6224139332771301, "(28, 16)": 0.4656367897987366, "(30, 0)": 0.6224139332771301, "(30, 16)": 0.6224139332771301}, "r_span": [891, 913], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.000775456428527832}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.5904463529586792, "(0, 16)": 0.5904463529586792, "(2, 0)": 0.5904463529586792, "(2, 16)": 0.5904463529586792, "(4, 0)": 0.5904463529586792, "(4, 16)": 0.5904463529586792, "(6, 0)": 0.5904463529586792, "(6, 16)": 0.7218155860900879, "(8, 0)": 0.5904463529586792, "(8, 16)": 0.5904463529586792, "(10, 0)": 0.5904463529586792, "(10, 16)": 0.5904463529586792, "(12, 0)": 0.5904463529586792, "(12, 16)": 0.6136001348495483, "(14, 0)": 0.5904463529586792, "(14, 16)": 0.5904463529586792, "(16, 0)": 0.534186840057373, "(16, 16)": 0.5904463529586792, "(18, 0)": 0.5904463529586792, "(18, 16)": 0.7218155860900879, "(20, 0)": 0.7218155860900879, "(20, 16)": 0.5904463529586792, "(22, 0)": 0.38194674253463745, "(22, 16)": 0.5851082801818848, "(24, 0)": 0.6136001348495483, "(24, 16)": 0.534186840057373, "(26, 0)": 0.38194674253463745, "(26, 16)": 0.534186840057373, "(28, 0)": 0.38194674253463745, "(28, 16)": 0.5904463529586792, "(30, 0)": 0.38194674253463745, "(30, 16)": 0.38194674253463745}, "r_span": [915, 1035], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": -0.00023430585861206055}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.6430137157440186, "(0, 16)": 0.6430137157440186, "(2, 0)": 0.6430137157440186, "(2, 16)": 0.6430137157440186, "(4, 0)": 0.6430137157440186, "(4, 16)": 0.6430137157440186, "(6, 0)": 0.6430137157440186, "(6, 16)": 0.6374229192733765, "(8, 0)": 0.6430137157440186, "(8, 16)": 0.6430137157440186, "(10, 0)": 0.6430137157440186, "(10, 16)": 0.6430137157440186, "(12, 0)": 0.6430137157440186, "(12, 16)": 0.6430137157440186, "(14, 0)": 0.6430137157440186, "(14, 16)": 0.4830677807331085, "(16, 0)": 0.6430137157440186, "(16, 16)": 0.6430137157440186, "(18, 0)": 0.4298423230648041, "(18, 16)": 0.5941934585571289, "(20, 0)": 0.6430137157440186, "(20, 16)": 0.6430137157440186, "(22, 0)": 0.4298423230648041, "(22, 16)": 0.6624104976654053, "(24, 0)": 0.5822595357894897, "(24, 16)": 0.6430137157440186, "(26, 0)": 0.4298423230648041, "(26, 16)": 0.6430137157440186, "(28, 0)": 0.4298423230648041, "(28, 16)": 0.4298423230648041, "(30, 0)": 0.4298423230648041, "(30, 16)": 0.4298423230648041}, "r_span": [1032, 1071], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.0003966689109802246}}]}, {"id": "10365", "source_id": "14830", "model": "llama-2-7b-chat", "temperature": 1.0, "labels": [{"start": 260, "end": 268, "text": "intimate", "meta": "HIGH INTRO OF NEW INFO\nAIGC: the atmosphere is  intimate\nOriginal: \"intimate\": null,\n", "label_type": "Evident Baseless Info", "implicit_true": false, "due_to_null": true}], "split": "test", "quality": "good", "response": "The Good Bar is a popular bar and restaurant located within the Kimpton Hotel in Goleta, California. With a rating of 4.0 stars, the bar offers a decent-sized full bar with plenty of seating, a Pool table, and free Wi-Fi. The atmosphere is classy, casual, and intimate, making it suitable for both groups and individuals. While the drinks are somewhat expensive, the service is generally good. However, there have been instances of poor staff management, particularly during busy periods, resulting in delayed orders and unpleasant experiences for some patrons. Despite this, many customers have praised the bar's ambiance, eclectic cocktail selection, and trivia nights, earning it a solid reputation in the area.\n\nHowever, one negative review stands out, detailing an unpleasant encounter with the bar's manager, Tyrell. A group of patrons were unwittingly kicked out of the bar after being invited in by the wedding guests, despite the bar's policy of allowing non-hotel guests inside. The manager's behavior was described as unprofessional and rude, leading the customers to boycott the establishment and file a complaint with the hotel front desk. Overall, while The Good Bar seems to offer a great experience for most customers, the occasional incidents of poor staff management raise concerns about the quality of service.", "response_spans":

Therefore, I am unable to answer the question based on this passage alone.\n\nPassage 2 describes how to fold a quilt into thirds along the bias of the fabric. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Lay the quilt on a flat surface.\n2. Fold the lower right corner up towards the center of the quilt, making sure the fold is on the bias.\n3. Fold the lower left corner up towards the center of the quilt, making sure the fold is on the bias.\n4. Fold the top left corner down towards the center of the quilt, making sure the fold is on the bias.\n5. Fold the top right corner down towards the center of the quilt, making sure the fold is on the bias.\n\nTherefore, based on Passage 2, you should fold a quilt by laying it flat and folding it in thirds along the bias of the fabric.\n\nPassage 3 does not provide instructions for folding a quilt.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided passages, the steps for folding a quilt are:\n\n1. Lay the quilt flat.\n2. Fold the quilt in thirds along the bias of the fabric.", "response_spans": [[0, 393], [395, 844], [846, 1200]], "scores": [{"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.8691942691802979, "(0, 16)": 0.8691942691802979, "(2, 0)": 0.8691942691802979, "(2, 16)": 0.8691942691802979, "(4, 0)": 0.8691942691802979, "(4, 16)": 0.8691942691802979, "(6, 0)": 0.8691942691802979, "(6, 16)": 0.8796542882919312, "(8, 0)": 0.8796542882919312, "(8, 16)": 0.8691942691802979, "(10, 0)": 0.8691942691802979, "(10, 16)": 0.8691942691802979, "(12, 0)": 0.8691942691802979, "(12, 16)": 0.8796542882919312, "(14, 0)": 0.8796542882919312, "(14, 16)": 0.8691942691802979, "(16, 0)": 0.8796542882919312, "(16, 16)": 0.8796542882919312, "(18, 0)": 0.8691942691802979, "(18, 16)": 0.8796542882919312, "(20, 0)": 0.8796542882919312, "(20, 16)": 0.8796542882919312, "(22, 0)": 0.8796542882919312, "(22, 16)": 0.8796542882919312, "(24, 0)": 0.8796542882919312, "(24, 16)": 0.8796542882919312, "(26, 0)": 0.8796542882919312, "(26, 16)": 0.8796542882919312, "(28, 0)": 0.8796542882919312, "(28, 16)": 0.8796542882919312, "(30, 0)": 0.8796542882919312, "(30, 16)": 0.8796542882919312}, "r_span": [372, 470], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.0028844475746154785}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.9272140264511108, "(0, 16)": 0.9272140264511108, "(2, 0)": 0.9272140264511108, "(2, 16)": 0.9272140264511108, "(4, 0)": 0.9272140264511108, "(4, 16)": 0.9272140264511108, "(6, 0)": 0.8399561643600464, "(6, 16)": 0.7995924353599548, "(8, 0)": 0.9272140264511108, "(8, 16)": 0.9272140264511108, "(10, 0)": 0.9272140264511108, "(10, 16)": 0.9272140264511108, "(12, 0)": 0.8399561643600464, "(12, 16)": 0.9272140264511108, "(14, 0)": 0.8399561643600464, "(14, 16)": 0.9272140264511108, "(16, 0)": 0.9272140264511108, "(16, 16)": 0.8399561643600464, "(18, 0)": 0.8399561643600464, "(18, 16)": 0.9272140264511108, "(20, 0)": 0.9272140264511108, "(20, 16)": 0.8399561643600464, "(22, 0)": 0.8399561643600464, "(22, 16)": 0.9272140264511108, "(24, 0)": 0.8399561643600464, "(24, 16)": 0.7995924353599548, "(26, 0)": 0.8399561643600464, "(26, 16)": 0.8399561643600464, "(28, 0)": 0.8399561643600464, "(28, 16)": 0.8399561643600464, "(30, 0)": 0.8399561643600464, "(30, 16)": 0.8399561643600464}, "r_span": [472, 596], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.00027549266815185547}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.8835161924362183, "(0, 16)": 0.8835161924362183, "(2, 0)": 0.8835161924362183, "(2, 16)": 0.8835161924362183, "(4, 0)": 0.8835161924362183, "(4, 16)": 0.8835161924362183, "(6, 0)": 0.8550204038619995, "(6, 16)": 0.8550204038619995, "(8, 0)": 0.8835161924362183, "(8, 16)": 0.8835161924362183, "(10, 0)": 0.8835161924362183, "(10, 16)": 0.8835161924362183, "(12, 0)": 0.8835161924362183, "(12, 16)": 0.8835161924362183, "(14, 0)": 0.8550204038619995, "(14, 16)": 0.8835161924362183, "(16, 0)": 0.8550204038619995, "(16, 16)": 0.8550204038619995, "(18, 0)": 0.8550204038619995, "(18, 16)": 0.8550204038619995, "(20, 0)": 0.8835161924362183, "(20, 16)": 0.8550204038619995, "(22, 0)": 0.8550204038619995, "(22, 16)": 0.8835161924362183, "(24, 0)": 0.8550204038619995, "(24, 16)": 0.8550204038619995, "(26, 0)": 0.8550204038619995, "(26, 16)": 0.8550204038619995, "(28, 0)": 0.8550204038619995, "(28, 16)": 0.8550204038619995, "(30, 0)": 0.8550204038619995, "(30, 16)": 0.8550204038619995}, "r_span": [598, 702], "hallucination_label": 1, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 4.887580871582031e-05}}]}, {"id": "12231", "source_id": "14355", "model": "llama-2-7b-chat", "temperature": 0.775, "labels": [], "split": "test", "quality": "good", "response": "Based on the provided passages, the benefits of using a water pick (also known as a Waterpik) include:\n\n1.

(Passage 1:4)\n2. Install bird netting over the top of your light fixture to block the birds' access to it. Choose a netting that is non-flammable and safe to use around light bulbs, and make sure it is installed so that it doesn't entangle birds. (Passage 2:1)\n3. Mount a plastic hawk on or near your porch. The sight of a predator can scare the birds away from the area and keep them from inhabiting your porch. Move the plastic hawk periodically to keep the birds from becoming accustomed to its presence.

Next, obtain a blood sample by pricking your finger or using a blood donation kit. This will require adult supervision, especially if you are doing it yourself.\n3. Place a drop of blood towards one end of a clean glass slide as instructed in Passage 2.\n4. Take another clean slide and, holding it at an angle of about 45 degrees, touch the blood with one end of the slide so that the blood runs along the edge of the slide through capillary action. Gently push the blood along the length of the first slide to produce a thin smear of blood. Repeat this step to make two smears.\n5.

The skeletal, muscular, digestive, respiratory, circulatory, urinary, endocrine, lymphatic, immune, and nervous systems all work together to help keep the body functioning normally. (Passage 1)\n2. The urinary system works closely with all other systems of the body to clean blood from the body and remove waste products from the skeletal, muscular, digestive, respiratory, circulatory, and nervous systems. (Passage 2)\n3. The respiratory system provides oxygen for all body parts and removes carbon dioxide from the muscular, digestive, skeletal, circulatory, urinary, and nervous systems. (Passage 3)\n\nTherefore, the body systems work together in the following ways:\n\n* The skeletal system provides support and structure for the body, while the muscular system helps move the body and its parts.\n* The digestive system breaks down food into nutrients that can be absorbed and used by the body, while the respiratory system provides oxygen for energy production.\n* The circulatory system delivers oxygenated blood to the body's cells and removes carbon dioxide, while the urinary system removes waste products from the blood.\n* The endocrine system produces hormones that regulate various bodily functions, including growth and development, metabolism, and reproductive processes.\n* The lymphatic system helps defend the body against infection and disease, while the immune system fights off foreign invaders.\n* The nervous system controls and coordinates the body's functions, including movement, sensation, and thought processes.\n\nOverall, the body's systems work together in a complex interplay to maintain homeostasis and ensure the proper functioning of the body.", "response_spans": [[0, 74], [76, 497], [498, 680], [682, 746], [748, 1204], [1205, 1610], [1612, 1747]],

Place eggs into a saucepan and pour in cold water to cover.\n2. Place the pan over high heat and bring the water to a boil.\n3. Once the water is simmering, turn off the heat, cover the pan with a lid, and let the eggs stand for 17 minutes.\n4. After 17 minutes, pour out the hot water and pour cold water over the eggs.\n\nPassage 2 provides tips for testing whether an egg is hard-boiled without breaking it:\n\n1. Whirl the egg on a table to test its hardness. If it spins fast and easily, it is hard-boiled.\n2. If the egg wobbles, it needs more time in the water.\n\nPassage 3 provides additional tips for making hard-boiled eggs easier to peel and avoiding common problems such as green-gray yolks:\n\n1. Place the cold eggs in a single layer in a pan with enough cold water to cover them by about 1 inch.\n2. Place the pan over high heat and bring the water to a boil.\n3. Turn off the heat, cover the pan, and remove it from the heat after 9 minutes for medium-sized eggs, 12 minutes for large eggs, or 15 minutes for extra-large eggs.\n4. Allow the eggs to sit in the water until they are cooked.\n\nBased on these passages, to bake hard-boiled eggs, follow these steps:\n\n1.

The PSA test is used to detect and monitor prostate cancer, as well as non-cancerous conditions such as prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The test involves taking a blood sample to be analyzed in a laboratory, and the results are typically reported as ng/mL (nanograms per milliliter) of blood.\n\nFrom the passages, we can infer the following meanings of PSA levels:\n\n* Elevated PSA levels may indicate prostate cancer, prostatitis, or an enlarged prostate. (Passage 2)\n* Total PSA levels between 4.0 ng/ml and 10.0 ng/ml may indicate prostate cancer, BPH, or inflammation of the prostate, with a higher likelihood in the elderly. (Passage 3)\n* Free PSA test can help to distinguish between prostate cancer and other non-cancer causes of elevated PSA levels.

To make a graph for your research, you can follow these general steps based on the provided passages:\n\n1. Collect your data: As stated in Passage 1, the first step is to collect all the data you want to represent in your graph. For example, if your goal is to compare the amount of rainfall in different months, you would need to measure and record the rainfall data for each month.\n2. Determine the type of graph: Based on the information provided in Passage 2, you can choose to make either a bar graph or a line graph. A bar graph is suitable for comparing groups or types, while a line graph is better suited for showing trends over time.\n3. Title your graph: According to Passage 2, it's important to title your graph to provide context and explain what the graph represents. Make sure to include a clear and concise title that describes the data being displayed.\n4. Find out how high your graph needs to go: As mentioned in Passage 2, you'll need to determine the height of your graph based on the data you're presenting. This will ensure that the bars or lines are proportional to the size of the categories they represent.\n5. Use appropriate scales: When making a bar graph, make sure to use appropriate scales on the x-axis (categories) and y-axis (values). This will allow the reader to easily interpret the data and understand the relationships between the categories.\n6. Proportionately size the bars: As noted in Passage 3, it's important to proportionally size the bars based on the size of the category they represent. This will create a clearer visual representation of the data and prevent any one category from dominating the graph.\n7. Add colors or labels: Depending on the type of graph you choose, you may want to add colors or labels to make it more visually appealing and easy to read.\n\nUnable to answer based on given passages.

Rub the roast with House Seasoning and place it on a rack in a roasting pan with the rib side down and the fatty side up.\n3. Roast the prime rib for 1 hour, then turn off the oven.\n4. While the roast is resting, prepare the au jus by placing the roasting pan on top of the stove over high heat. Cook the au jus for 8-10 minutes, stirring and scraping any brown bits.\n5. Add the wine to the au jus and cook for 20 minutes or until the juice has reduced by half. Season the au jus with salt and pepper to taste.\n6. Return the prime rib to the oven and baste it with the au jus every 20-30 minutes during the last 20-30 minutes of cooking.\n7. After 20-30 minutes of basting, check the internal temperature of the prime rib with a meat thermometer. It should reach an internal temperature of 130°F to 135°F for medium-rare, 140°F to 145°F for medium, and 150°F to 155°F for medium-well.\n8. Once the prime rib reaches the desired internal temperature, remove it from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving.\n\nNote: These instructions are based on the given passages and may not be suitable for larger or smaller roasts. Additionally, adjust the cooking time and temperature as needed based on the size and thickness of the prime rib.", "response_spans": [[0, 95], [97, 571], [572, 841], [842, 1237], [1239, 1463]],

"good", "response": "Based on the provided passages, here are some steps for attaching multiple picture frames together:\n\nPassage 1: Table-Stand Grouping\nTo join two or three frames together, you can use identical frames or one larger frame as the middle piece. Place the frames beside each other to see if you like the effect, and then mark the hinge placement on the connecting sides. Attach two small hinges to the marked areas to join the frames together.\n\nPassage 2: Hanging Multiple Pictures Together\nBefore attaching the frames together, test different arrangements of the group of multiple pictures on the floor. Once you have decided on the layout, screw the frames to the backer board, repeating the process for each frame. Attach a hanging wire to the back of the frames and hang them on the wall to enjoy the finished result.\n\nPassage 3: Attaching Frames Together\nTo attach two frames together, place them back to back and mark the hinge placement on the connecting sides. The placement should be the same distance from the bottom edge of each frame to ensure stability when the grouped pictures are placed on a table. Attach two small hinges to the marked areas to join the frames together.\n\nIn conclusion, the recommended method for attaching multiple picture frames together involves using identical or matching frames, marking the hinge placement on the connecting sides, and attaching small hinges to join the frames together. It's also important to test different arrangements of the group of pictures on the floor before attaching the frames together, and to ensure that the frames are securely attached to the backer board before hanging them on the wall.", "response_spans": [[0, 438], [440, 816], [818, 1182], [1184, 1654]], "scores": [{"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.8455883264541626, "(0, 16)":

passages, here is how to remove oil stains from a concrete driveway:\n\n1. For fresh oil stains, try using a poultice method by applying a commercial-grade cleaner to the affected area and scrubbing with a brush or broom.\n2. For larger or older oil stains, use a pressure washer with detergent to clean the area. Apply the cleaner at a consistent distance from the surface of the concrete and move the nozzle in an even pattern to prevent streaking.\n3. Before cleaning, remove any dirt or debris from the area around the oil stain using a hose or bucket of water. Avoid using a high-pressure hose as it can push the oil deeper into the pavement.\n4. The choice of cleaner depends on the type of stain, with oven cleaner, goop hand cleaner, and carburetor cleaner being mentioned as options in passage 1.\n5. If the stain is still difficult to remove after using these methods, consider using a professional cleaning service.

Pot Design: Crab traps are designed with a system of nets inside a large metal cage made of wire or flat metal mesh, which is reinforced with steel bars. The traps are designed to allow crabs in but not let them out. (Passage 1)\n2. Getting the Catch: A crab pot is a large square about 2 feet high and 8 feet wide. The trap has two ends with lead-ins that angle into the trap from the sides and bottom to a narrow slit about 2 feet into the pot. This slit is the only entrance into the trap, and the crabs must crawl up the leads to get to their free meal. (Passage 1)\n3. Tweet: The author recommends using topless crab traps, which seem to work best. (Passage 2)\n4. The Trap Is Set: King crab pots can range in size from about 6 by 6 feet to about 8 by 8 feet, with heights between about 2 and 3 feet. Over time, mechanisms such as biodegradable mesh or dissolvable cord can disable crab pots, making them unable to trap any more crabs that wander inside and preventing them from ghost fishing. (Passage 3)\n\nTherefore, based on the given passages, crab traps are designed with a system of nets inside a metal cage, have a narrow slit as the only entrance, and can be made topless for better performance.", "response_spans": [[0, 60], [62, 293], [294, 728], [729, 1072], [1074, 1269]], "scores": [{"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.6919689178466797, "(0, 16)": 0.6919689178466797, "(2,

They are responsible for bringing the retail strategy and company goals to life in the store through effective display and presentation of products. The passage also emphasizes the importance of visual merchandising in influencing consumer behavior, particularly in the context of shop windows.\n\nThe second passage discusses the role of merchandisers in making the product interesting and appealing to consumers, drawing a comparison between the role of marketers (who bring customers to the store) and merchandisers (who make them buy).\n\nThe third passage focuses specifically on the impact of visual merchandising on consumer buying behavior, particularly in terms of the effect of shop window displays on consumer behavior. The passage also considers the influence of other factors such as sex and store attributes on consumer behavior.\n\nOverall, these passages suggest that visual merchandising plays a crucial role in

Once the temperature reaches 150°F, remove the roast from the oven and let it rest for 30 minutes before slicing and serving.\n\nBased on these passages, the general steps to cook a frozen pork loin roast in the oven are:\n\n1. Defrost the roast if not already thawed.\n2. Season the roast with salt, pepper, and herbs.\n3. Place the roast in a preheated oven at the appropriate temperature (250°F or 325°F) for the specified time.\n4. Check the internal temperature of the roast using a meat thermometer to ensure it reaches the desired doneness.\n5. Remove the roast from the oven and let it rest for 30 minutes before slicing and serving.", "response_spans": [[0, 376], [378, 676], [678, 1149], [1151, 1563]], "scores": [{"prompt_attention_score":

The exact cost will depend on factors such as the complexity of the addition, the quality of materials used, and local labor rates.\n\nFor example, according to Passage 1, the cost of hiring a remodeling contractor to build a second floor addition can range from $100 to $300 per square foot, depending on the complexity of the addition and the location. Similarly, Passage 2 provides a cost range of $3.74 to $4.83 per square foot for installing carpet, which suggests that the cost of other materials and labor for a second floor installation could be similar.\n\nHowever, Passage 3 provides a specific cost estimate for a ground-level deck of $30 per square foot, which may not directly apply to a second floor installation. Nonetheless, this passage does provide some insight into the overall cost range for a deck construction project, which could be used as a rough estimate for the cost of a second floor installation.\n\nOverall, based on the information provided in the passages, it is difficult to give an exact answer to the question without additional context or details about the specific project.

After cooling, the skin can be easily peeled off. This method takes 15 minutes to cook the potatoes and 5 seconds to peel each one.\n\nPassage 2 suggests peeling the potatoes before cooking, as their skin can be tough and papery. However, no specific instructions are provided for peeling.\n\nPassage 3 provides a step-by-step guide for peeling cooked potatoes. The method involves scoring the potatoes all the way around the center, boiling them for about 15 minutes, then placing them in an ice water bath to cool. Once cooled, the skin can be easily removed. This method takes about 30 minutes total time.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided passages, the best way to boil potatoes for easy peeling is to boil them until tender, then transfer them to an ice water bath to stop the cooking process and make the skin easier to remove. Scoring the potatoes before boiling can also help loosen the skin for easier peeling.", "response_spans": [[0, 504], [506, 821], [823, 1132]], "scores": [{"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.8578183650970459, "(0, 16)": 0.8578183650970459, "(2, 0)": 0.8578183650970459, "(2, 16)": 0.8578183650970459, "(4, 0)": 0.8578183650970459, "(4, 16)": 0.8578183650970459, "(6, 0)": 0.8578183650970459, "(6, 16)": 0.9467685222625732, "(8, 0)": 0.8578183650970459, "(8, 16)": 0.8578183650970459, "(10, 0)": 0.8578183650970459, "(10, 16)": 0.8578183650970459, "(12, 0)": 0.8578183650970459, "(12, 16)": 0.9467685222625732, "(14, 0)": 0.8578183650970459, "(14, 16)": 0.9467685222625732, "(16, 0)": 0.9467685222625732, "(16, 16)": 0.8578183650970459, "(18, 0)": 0.8578183650970459, "(18, 16)": 0.9467685222625732, "(20, 0)": 0.9467685222625732, "(20, 16)": 0.8578183650970459, "(22, 0)": 0.8578183650970459, "(22, 16)": 0.9467685222625732, "(24, 0)": 0.8578183650970459, "(24, 16)": 0.9467685222625732, "(26, 0)": 0.8578183650970459, "(26, 16)": 0.8578183650970459, "(28, 0)": 0.8578183650970459, "(28, 16)": 0.8578183650970459, "(30, 0)": 0.8578183650970459, "(30, 16)": 0.8578183650970459}, "r_span": [449, 579], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.000594019889831543}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.8626933693885803, "(0, 16)": 0.8626933693885803, "(2, 0)": 0.8626933693885803, "(2, 16)": 0.8626933693885803, "(4, 0)": 0.8626933693885803, "(4, 16)": 0.8626933693885803, "(6, 0)": 0.8626933693885803, "(6, 16)": 0.9022650122642517, "(8, 0)": 0.8626933693885803, "(8, 16)": 0.8626933693885803, "(10, 0)": 0.8626933693885803, "(10, 16)": 0.8626933693885803, "(12, 0)": 0.8626933693885803, "(12, 16)": 0.8626933693885803, "(14, 0)": 0.8626933693885803, "(14, 16)": 0.8626933693885803, "(16, 0)": 0.8626933693885803, "(16, 16)": 0.8626933693885803, "(18, 0)": 0.8626933693885803, "(18, 16)": 0.8626933693885803, "(20, 0)": 0.8626933693885803, "(20, 16)": 0.8626933693885803, "(22, 0)": 0.8626933693885803, "(22, 16)": 0.8626933693885803, "(24, 0)": 0.8626933693885803, "(24, 16)": 0.8626933693885803, "(26, 0)": 0.8626933693885803, "(26, 16)": 0.8626933693885803, "(28, 0)": 0.8626933693885803, "(28, 16)": 0.8626933693885803, "(30, 0)": 0.8626933693885803, "(30, 16)": 0.8626933693885803}, "r_span": [581, 659], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": -0.00024759769439697266}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.8194478154182434, "(0, 16)": 0.8194478154182434, "(2, 0)": 0.8194478154182434, "(2, 16)": 0.8194478154182434, "(4, 0)": 0.8194478154182434, "(4, 16)": 0.8194478154182434, "(6, 0)": 0.8194478154182434, "(6, 16)": 0.8853543996810913, "(8, 0)": 0.8194478154182434, "(8, 16)": 0.8194478154182434, "(10, 0)": 0.8194478154182434, "(10, 16)": 0.8194478154182434, "(12, 0)": 0.8194478154182434, "(12, 16)": 0.8194478154182434, "(14, 0)": 0.8194478154182434, "(14, 16)": 0.37497997283935547, "(16, 0)": 0.8853543996810913, "(16, 16)": 0.8194478154182434, "(18, 0)": 0.8194478154182434, "(18, 16)": 0.8853543996810913, "(20, 0)": 0.8853543996810913, "(20, 16)": 0.8194478154182434, "(22, 0)": 0.8194478154182434, "(22, 16)": 0.8853543996810913, "(24, 0)": 0.8194478154182434, "(24, 16)": 0.8194478154182434, "(26, 0)": 0.8194478154182434, "(26, 16)": 0.8194478154182434, "(28, 0)": 0.8194478154182434, "(28, 16)": 0.8194478154182434, "(30, 0)": 0.8194478154182434, "(30, 16)": 0.8194478154182434}, "r_span": [661, 733], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.00038117170333862305}}]}, {"id": "14367", "source_id": "15315", "model": "llama-2-7b-chat", "temperature": 0.775, "labels": [], "split": "test", "quality": "good", "response": "Based on the provided passages, here's how to get rid of ticks from dogs:\n\n1.

Apply a basecoat of flat or satin paint to the wood surface ( passage 3). Satin paint is easier to work with, but flat paint will give a more aged look.\n2. Mix paint that is two shades darker than the basecoat with an equal amount of glaze ( passage 3). Once the basecoat is dry, drizzle a crumpled rag or plastic bag in the glaze mixture to achieve an aged appearance.\n3. Layer stain on top of the paint to create a cool effect ( passage 1). This technique involves applying multiple layers of stain and allowing them to dry between coats.\n4. Use a palette knife to spread a mixture of molding paste and a rust or dull color on a canvas, letting it dry before adding additional layers ( passage 2). This can help create an embossed design with an antique finish.\n5. Apply a thin layer of burnt sienna or a similar color to give the wood a vintage look ( passage 3). Dabbing the paint with a paper towel or cloth can help remove excess paint and achieve a more subtle, aged appearance.\n\nOverall, the key to achieving an antique effect on wood using normal paint is to layer different materials and colors to create a weathered and worn appearance.", "response_spans": [[0, 108], [110, 482], [483, 876], [877, 1098], [1100, 1260]], "scores":

Rocks are typically larger and more massive than stones, which are smaller and more fragmented.\n\nPassage 1 states that rocks are often used to refer to something solid, large, and grounded, such as a mountain or palisade, while stones are often used to refer to small pieces of rock or pebbles. Passage 2 defines rocks as the hard material of the earth's crust that is exposed on the surface of the earth or underlying the soil, while stones are smaller fragments of rock that can be carried in the hand.\n\nPassage 3 further clarifies the distinction by stating that rocks are made up of smaller stones, while stones are made from rocks. Additionally, rocks are described as being difficult to carry in the hand, while stones are small enough to be carried easily.\n\nIn summary, while both rocks and stones are made of the same material, they differ in size and usage.

fertilization, and mortality is highest for conjoined twins due to the many complications resulting from shared organs.\n* Dizygotic twin pregnancies: These twins are slightly more likely to occur in women who are of West African descent (especially Yoruba), between the ages of 30 and 40, are taller and heavier than average, and have had several previous pregnancies.\n* Identical twins (monozygotic): These twins develop from one zygote, which splits and forms two embryos.\n* Fraternal twins (dizygotic): These twins develop from two different eggs, and each twin is fertilized by its own sperm cell.\n\nUnable to answer based on given passages: The passage does not provide information on the exact timing or mechanism of twinning beyond what is mentioned above.", "response_spans":

Fire helps to clear the way for new growth by consuming dead, decaying vegetation on the forest floor, creating a clean slate for seed germination and seedling establishment (Passage 2).\n2. Jack pine seeds are adapted to fire, as they are stored in serotinous cones that only open after a fire has melted the resin holding them closed. This allows the seeds to disperse and establish new populations (Passage 2).\n3. Fire can create a favorable environment for jack pine and aspen regrowth by reducing competition from other tree species, such as spruce, which have better access to sunlight while shading the other

Therefore, I cannot provide guidance on this matter based on this passage.\n\nPassage 2 explains the process for placing a lien on business property through a court order. It outlines the steps involved in filing a claim with the court and submitting proof of the amount owed to you, followed by the business's response to the debt. However, this passage does not provide information on how to file a lien on a semi.\n\nPassage 3 provides instructions on how to file a lien on a specific type of property called an \"OTC\" (Off-Highway Motor Vehicle Account). The passage explains how one copy of the lien entry form, along with supporting documents, will be attached to the titling documentation, while another copy will be sent to the Michigan Liquor Control Commission.

1765 with a mix of violent and non-violent protests, starting with peaceful demonstrations such as holding signs and chanting slogans like \"No Taxation without Representation\". However, some of these protests led to confrontations with British soldiers, resulting in arrests.\n\nThe colonists were upset about the Stamp Act because it was the first direct tax imposed by Parliament on the colonies, which they saw as a violation of their rights as British subjects and a breach of their consent to be governed under the British Constitution. They believed that no taxes could be levied on them without their representation in Parliament, which they did not have at the time. The Stamp Act required the use of tax-stamped paper for all newspapers, legal documents, and other printed materials, which further annoyed the colonists who felt that it interfered with their freedom of speech and press.\n\nTherefore, the colonists responded to the Stamp Act with a variety of measures, including public protests, legislative resolutions, town meetings, and citizen boycotts of British goods. While the Stamp Act went into effect on November 1, 1765, it was eventually repealed by Parliament on March 18, 1766, and replaced with the Declaratory Act, which reaffirmed Parliament's authority to make laws binding on the colonies.", "response_spans": [[0, 351], [353, 855], [838, 970], [972, 1392]], "scores": [{"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.7817338705062866, "(0, 16)":

"good", "response": "Based on the provided passages, here is how raffles work:\n\n1. Reverse Raffle: In this type of raffle, the numbers on the entry tickets are drawn in reverse order, starting with the last number and ending with the first number. For example, if there are 55 entries, the last number drawn wins the grand prize, followed by the next-to-last number, and so on until the first number. Each entry ticket costs $50, and a table of 20 individuals constitutes one complete ticket worth $1,000 and two $500 prizes (for the early bird drawing and the first ticket pulled).\n2. 50-50 Draw: This is a raffle held during a single day at a specific event. Tickets are sold to patrons throughout the event by roving staff with handheld electronic devices. The gross proceeds of 50-50 tickets sold at the event go into a prize pool, and 50% of the prize pool is awarded to the winner of a random draw that takes place at the end of the event. The remaining 50% goes to a charitable purpose chosen by the sporting club.\n3. Additional Raffles: In addition to the main raffle, there may be additional raffles for drinks and dinner. These raffles are not included in the original ticket price and require separate entry fees. One of these raffles offers the chance to win $10,000!\n\nUnable to answer based on given passages.", "response_spans": [[0, 57], [59, 561], [562, 1000], [1001, 1258], [1260, 1301]], "scores":

A transistor functions as both an amplifier and a switch.\n2. The transistor's design allows it to control a larger supply of electricity with a small amount of electricity, much like turning a valve to control a supply of water.\n3. The base of the transistor pulls electrons from the emitter, creating a flow of electricity through the transistor.\n4. The transistor can take in a tiny electric current at one end (the input current) and produce a much bigger electric current at the other end (the output current) when it works as an amplifier.\n5. The holes in the base of the transistor act as a barrier, preventing any significant current flow from the emitter to the collector when the transistor is in its off state.\n6. When the electrons and holes move across the two junctions between the n-type and p-type silicon, the transistor begins to work.\n7. The collector current is approximately beta (common-emitter current gain) times the base current, and it is typically greater than 100 for small-signal transistors but can be smaller in transistors designed for high-power applications.\n\nUnable to answer based on the given passages.", "response_spans": [[0, 63], [65, 415], [416, 920], [921, 1159], [1161, 1206]], "scores":

According to this perspective, global justice requires that all individuals have equal access to resources and opportunities, regardless of their cultural background or location.\n\nThe first passage highlights the limitations of global egalitarianism by arguing that measuring the resources or opportunities available to people in different societies in a way that is neutral as between cultures is impossible. Therefore, the principle of global justice cannot be based solely on equality of resources or equality of opportunity.\n\nThe second passage notes that the world is highly unequal in socio-economic terms, with certain individuals and groups having more wealth and opportunities than others. This inequality is seen as a major challenge to global justice.\n\nThe third passage distinguishes between instrumental and non-instrumental forms of egalitarianism. Instrumental egalitarianism seeks to promote equality as a means to achieve some other goal, while non-instrumental egalitarianism values equality for its own sake or as partially constituting some other end.\n\nTherefore, based on the given passages, global egalitarianism can be understood as a conception of global justice that prioritizes equality among individuals and groups worldwide, but recognizes the challenges involved in measuring and achieving equality in a global context.", "response_spans": [[0, 416], [418, 766], [768, 1000], [1002, 1309], [1311, 1586]], "scores":

It's important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise program.", "response_spans": [[0, 190], [192, 623], [625, 988]], "scores": [{"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.6583503484725952, "(0, 16)": 0.6583503484725952, "(2, 0)": 0.6583503484725952, "(2, 16)": 0.6583503484725952, "(4, 0)": 0.6583503484725952, "(4, 16)": 0.6583503484725952, "(6, 0)": 0.6583503484725952, "(6, 16)": 0.8170790076255798, "(8, 0)": 0.6583503484725952, "(8, 16)": 0.6583503484725952, "(10, 0)": 0.6583503484725952, "(10, 16)": 0.6583503484725952, "(12, 0)": 0.6583503484725952, "(12, 16)": 0.8170790076255798, "(14, 0)": 0.6583503484725952, "(14, 16)": 0.6583503484725952, "(16, 0)": 0.8170790076255798, "(16, 16)": 0.6583503484725952, "(18, 0)": 0.6583503484725952, "(18, 16)": 0.8170790076255798, "(20, 0)": 0.8170790076255798, "(20, 16)": 0.8170790076255798, "(22, 0)": 0.8170790076255798, "(22, 16)": 0.8170790076255798, "(24, 0)": 0.6583503484725952, "(24, 16)": 0.8170790076255798, "(26, 0)": 0.8170790076255798, "(26, 16)": 0.8170790076255798, "(28, 0)": 0.6583503484725952, "(28, 16)": 0.8170790076255798, "(30, 0)": 0.8170790076255798, "(30, 16)": 0.6583503484725952}, "r_span": [288, 330], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": -0.0006883144378662109}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.8220270276069641, "(0, 16)": 0.8220270276069641, "(2, 0)": 0.8220270276069641, "(2, 16)": 0.8220270276069641, "(4, 0)": 0.8220270276069641, "(4, 16)": 0.8220270276069641, "(6, 0)": 0.8220270276069641, "(6, 16)": 0.8326807022094727, "(8, 0)": 0.8220270276069641, "(8, 16)": 0.8220270276069641, "(10, 0)": 0.8220270276069641, "(10, 16)": 0.8220270276069641, "(12, 0)": 0.8220270276069641, "(12, 16)": 0.8220270276069641, "(14, 0)": 0.8326807022094727, "(14, 16)": 0.8220270276069641, "(16, 0)": 0.8326807022094727, "(16, 16)": 0.8326807022094727, "(18, 0)": 0.8326807022094727, "(18, 16)": 0.8326807022094727, "(20, 0)": 0.8220270276069641, "(20, 16)": 0.8326807022094727, "(22, 0)": 0.8220270276069641, "(22, 16)": 0.8220270276069641, "(24, 0)": 0.8326807022094727, "(24, 16)": 0.8326807022094727, "(26, 0)": 0.8326807022094727, "(26, 16)": 0.8220270276069641, "(28, 0)": 0.8326807022094727, "(28, 16)": 0.8326807022094727, "(30, 0)": 0.8326807022094727, "(30, 16)": 0.8326807022094727}, "r_span": [332, 436], "hallucination_label": 1, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.00018042325973510742}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.6894022226333618, "(0, 16)": 0.6894022226333618, "(2, 0)": 0.6894022226333618, "(2, 16)": 0.6894022226333618, "(4, 0)": 0.6894022226333618, "(4, 16)": 0.6894022226333618, "(6, 0)": 0.6894022226333618, "(6, 16)": 0.8801372051239014, "(8, 0)": 0.6894022226333618, "(8, 16)": 0.6894022226333618, "(10, 0)": 0.6894022226333618, "(10, 16)": 0.6894022226333618, "(12, 0)": 0.6894022226333618, "(12, 16)": 0.8801372051239014, "(14, 0)": 0.8801372051239014, "(14, 16)": 0.6894022226333618, "(16, 0)": 0.8801372051239014, "(16, 16)": 0.8801372051239014, "(18, 0)": 0.8801372051239014, "(18, 16)": 0.8801372051239014, "(20, 0)": 0.8801372051239014, "(20, 16)": 0.8801372051239014, "(22, 0)": 0.8801372051239014, "(22, 16)": 0.6894022226333618, "(24, 0)": 0.8801372051239014, "(24, 16)": 0.8801372051239014, "(26, 0)": 0.8801372051239014, "(26, 16)": 0.6894022226333618, "(28, 0)": 0.8801372051239014, "(28, 16)": 0.8801372051239014, "(30, 0)": 0.8801372051239014, "(30, 16)": 0.8801372051239014}, "r_span": [438, 508], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 4.929304122924805e-05}}]}, {"id": "16509", "source_id": "12243", "model": "llama-2-7b-chat", "temperature": 0.775, "labels": [{"start": 649, "end": 1201, "text": "3.

If you don't have enough muscle mass, then you won't be able to see definition or tone, even if you have a low body fat percentage.\n2.

It recommends placing the potato chunks on a tray or cookie sheet and setting them in a cool, dark location overnight to allow the cut ends to dry out before planting. This step is important as it helps prevent rot and ensures the potatoes have the best chance of growing successfully.\n\nPassage 2 provides an overview of the process of planting seed potatoes, including the fact that they go through three stages: young seed, middle aged, and old. However, it does not provide specific instructions for planting sprouted potatoes.\n\nPassage 3 provides more detailed instructions for planting potatoes, including turning the soil over in the planned planting area, digging a trench, and cutting the potatoes into cubes with a sprout on each cube. It recommends covering the potatoes with a layer of compost and replacing the dirt on top of the plantings.\n\nBased on these passages, here are the steps to plant a sprouted potato:\n\n1. Cut the sprouted potato into chunks with two or three eyes each, using a sharp knife.\n2. Allow the cut ends to dry out in a cool, dark location overnight.\n3. Dig a trench about 4 inches wide and 6 to 8 inches deep in the planned planting area.\n4. Place the dried-out potato chunks into the bottom of the trench, separating each chunk by about 6 to 8 inches.\n5. Cover the potatoes with a layer of compost.\n6.

Here's my answer to the question:\n\nThe weighted average method of costing inventory assigns an average cost to each piece of inventory when it is sold. When a unit of inventory is sold, the weighted average method takes the average cost of all inventories currently available and assigns that average price to the item sold. Since inventory prices fluctuate, the weighted average cost will also change.\n\nTo calculate the weighted average cost per unit, divide the cost of goods available for sale by the number of units available for sale. The weighted-average figure can then be used to assign costs to both ending inventory and cost of goods sold. The recorded amount of inventory on hand using the weighted average costing method represents a value between the oldest and newest units purchased into stock.\n\nWeighted average costing is commonly used in situations where inventory items are intermingled and it is impossible to assign a specific cost to an individual unit, or when the accounting system is not sophisticated enough to track FIFO or LIFO inventory layers.", "response_spans": [[0, 408], [410, 815], [817, 1079]], "scores": [{"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.9267607927322388, "(0, 16)": 0.9267607927322388, "(2, 0)": 0.9267607927322388, "(2, 16)": 0.9267607927322388, "(4, 0)": 0.9267607927322388, "(4, 16)": 0.9267607927322388, "(6, 0)": 0.9267607927322388, "(6, 16)": 0.9408198595046997, "(8, 0)": 0.7773536443710327, "(8, 16)": 0.422347754240036, "(10, 0)": 0.422347754240036, "(10, 16)": 0.9267607927322388, "(12, 0)": 0.8591616153717041, "(12, 16)": 0.9408198595046997, "(14, 0)": 0.9408198595046997, "(14, 16)": 0.9267607927322388, "(16, 0)": 0.818378210067749, "(16, 16)": 0.9408198595046997, "(18, 0)": 0.422347754240036, "(18, 16)": 0.9408198595046997, "(20, 0)": 0.9408198595046997, "(20, 16)": 0.7773536443710327, "(22, 0)": 0.9408198595046997, "(22, 16)": 0.9408198595046997, "(24, 0)": 0.7773536443710327, "(24, 16)": 0.9408198595046997, "(26, 0)": 0.9408198595046997, "(26, 16)": 0.9408198595046997, "(28, 0)": 0.9408198595046997, "(28, 16)": 0.7773536443710327, "(30, 0)": 0.7773536443710327, "(30, 16)": 0.9408198595046997}, "r_span": [589, 681], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.002579808235168457}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.8933944702148438, "(0, 16)": 0.8933944702148438, "(2, 0)": 0.8933944702148438, "(2, 16)": 0.41410985589027405, "(4, 0)": 0.8933944702148438, "(4, 16)": 0.8933944702148438, "(6, 0)": 0.8933944702148438, "(6, 16)": 0.9223744869232178, "(8, 0)": 0.7845607399940491, "(8, 16)": 0.7845607399940491, "(10, 0)": 0.7845607399940491, "(10, 16)": 0.8933944702148438, "(12, 0)": 0.7845607399940491, "(12, 16)": 0.9223744869232178, "(14, 0)": 0.7845607399940491, "(14, 16)": 0.8933944702148438, "(16, 0)": 0.9223744869232178, "(16, 16)": 0.8615680932998657, "(18, 0)": 0.8615680932998657, "(18, 16)": 0.9223744869232178, "(20, 0)": 0.9223744869232178, "(20, 16)": 0.7845607399940491, "(22, 0)": 0.8615680932998657, "(22, 16)": 0.7845607399940491, "(24, 0)": 0.7845607399940491, "(24, 16)": 0.9223744869232178, "(26, 0)": 0.8615680932998657, "(26, 16)": 0.8615680932998657, "(28, 0)": 0.7845607399940491, "(28, 16)": 0.7845607399940491, "(30, 0)": 0.7845607399940491, "(30, 16)": 0.8615680932998657}, "r_span": [683, 765], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.001128852367401123}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.7949733138084412, "(0, 16)": 0.7949733138084412, "(2, 0)": 0.7949733138084412, "(2, 16)": 0.7949733138084412, "(4, 0)": 0.7949733138084412, "(4, 16)": 0.7949733138084412, "(6, 0)": 0.8261914253234863, "(6, 16)": 0.8261914253234863, "(8, 0)": 0.8261914253234863, "(8, 16)": 0.8261914253234863, "(10, 0)": 0.8261914253234863, "(10, 16)": 0.7949733138084412, "(12, 0)": 0.7949733138084412, "(12, 16)": 0.8261914253234863, "(14, 0)": 0.8261914253234863, "(14, 16)": 0.8261914253234863, "(16, 0)": 0.8261914253234863, "(16, 16)": 0.8261914253234863, "(18, 0)": 0.8261914253234863, "(18, 16)": 0.8261914253234863, "(20, 0)": 0.8261914253234863, "(20, 16)": 0.8261914253234863, "(22, 0)": 0.7734242677688599, "(22, 16)": 0.8261914253234863, "(24, 0)": 0.8261914253234863, "(24, 16)": 0.8261914253234863, "(26, 0)": 0.7734242677688599, "(26, 16)": 0.8261914253234863, "(28, 0)": 0.8261914253234863, "(28, 16)": 0.8261914253234863, "(30, 0)": 0.8261914253234863, "(30, 16)": 0.7734242677688599}, "r_span": [767, 823], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.0013783574104309082}}]}, {"id": "17061", "source_id": "12335", "model": "llama-2-7b-chat", "temperature": 0.925, "labels": [], "split": "test", "quality": "good", "response": "Based on the provided passages, here are some benefits and side effects of drinking clove tea:\n\nBenefits:\n\n* Relieves stress and anxiety (Passage 1)\n* Provides relief from muscle, joint, or ligament injuries (Passage 2)\n* Soothes abdominal pain (Passage 3)\n* Stimulates blood flow, saliva production, and gastric secretions to aid in digestion (Passage 3)\n\nSide Effects:\n\n* Unknown (no passage mentions any potential side effects)\n\nTherefore, based on the provided passages, it appears that drinking clove tea may have several benefits, including relieving stress and abdominal pain, and aiding in digestion.

Therefore, actively engaging with Snapchat stories and content by watching and interacting with them can help increase one's score on the platform.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer to the question \"Does watching Snapchat stories increase score?\" is yes, based on the information provided in the passages.", "response_spans": [[0, 512], [493, 640], [642, 791]], "scores": [{"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.9026398658752441, "(0, 16)": 0.9026398658752441, "(2, 0)": 0.9026398658752441, "(2, 16)": 0.9026398658752441, "(4, 0)": 0.9026398658752441, "(4, 16)": 0.9026398658752441, "(6, 0)": 0.9026398658752441, "(6, 16)": 0.9134935140609741, "(8, 0)": 0.9026398658752441, "(8, 16)": 0.9026398658752441, "(10, 0)": 0.5111105442047119, "(10, 16)": 0.9026398658752441, "(12, 0)": 0.9026398658752441, "(12, 16)": 0.9134935140609741, "(14, 0)": 0.9026398658752441, "(14, 16)": 0.5111105442047119, "(16, 0)": 0.9026398658752441, "(16, 16)": 0.8889683485031128, "(18, 0)": 0.8889683485031128, "(18, 16)": 0.9026398658752441, "(20, 0)": 0.9026398658752441, "(20, 16)": 0.8889683485031128, "(22, 0)": 0.8889683485031128, "(22, 16)": 0.9134935140609741, "(24, 0)": 0.8889683485031128, "(24, 16)": 0.9026398658752441, "(26, 0)": 0.8889683485031128, "(26, 16)": 0.8889683485031128, "(28, 0)": 0.8889683485031128, "(28, 16)": 0.8889683485031128, "(30, 0)": 0.8889683485031128, "(30, 16)": 0.8889683485031128}, "r_span": [505, 617], "hallucination_label": 1, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.0019202232360839844}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.7596496939659119, "(0, 16)": 0.7596496939659119, "(2, 0)": 0.7596496939659119, "(2, 16)": 0.7596496939659119, "(4, 0)": 0.7596496939659119, "(4, 16)": 0.7596496939659119, "(6, 0)": 0.7596496939659119, "(6, 16)": 0.7661375999450684, "(8, 0)": 0.7596496939659119, "(8, 16)": 0.7596496939659119, "(10, 0)": 0.7596496939659119, "(10, 16)": 0.7596496939659119, "(12, 0)": 0.7661375999450684, "(12, 16)": 0.7661375999450684, "(14, 0)": 0.7661375999450684, "(14, 16)": 0.40955573320388794, "(16, 0)": 0.7661375999450684, "(16, 16)": 0.7661375999450684, "(18, 0)": 0.7661375999450684, "(18, 16)": 0.7661375999450684, "(20, 0)": 0.7657936811447144, "(20, 16)": 0.7661375999450684, "(22, 0)": 0.7661375999450684, "(22, 16)": 0.7661375999450684, "(24, 0)": 0.7661375999450684, "(24, 16)": 0.7661375999450684, "(26, 0)": 0.7661375999450684, "(26, 16)": 0.7661375999450684, "(28, 0)": 0.7661375999450684, "(28, 16)": 0.7661375999450684, "(30, 0)": 0.7661375999450684, "(30, 16)": 0.7661375999450684}, "r_span": [614, 644], "hallucination_label": 0, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.0003763437271118164}}, {"prompt_attention_score": {"(0, 0)": 0.7543789148330688, "(0, 16)": 0.7543789148330688, "(2, 0)": 0.7543789148330688, "(2, 16)": 0.5941528081893921, "(4, 0)": 0.5941528081893921, "(4, 16)": 0.5941528081893921, "(6, 0)": 0.7543789148330688, "(6, 16)": 0.8741865158081055, "(8, 0)": 0.7543789148330688, "(8, 16)": 0.7543789148330688, "(10, 0)": 0.5941528081893921, "(10, 16)": 0.5941528081893921, "(12, 0)": 0.5941528081893921, "(12, 16)": 0.5941528081893921, "(14, 0)": 0.7325694561004639, "(14, 16)": 0.5941528081893921, "(16, 0)": 0.8741865158081055, "(16, 16)": 0.7325694561004639, "(18, 0)": 0.7325694561004639, "(18, 16)": 0.8741865158081055, "(20, 0)": 0.8741865158081055, "(20, 16)": 0.7325694561004639, "(22, 0)": 0.7325694561004639, "(22, 16)": 0.8741865158081055, "(24, 0)": 0.7325694561004639, "(24, 16)": 0.5941528081893921, "(26, 0)": 0.7325694561004639, "(26, 16)": 0.7325694561004639, "(28, 0)": 0.7325694561004639, "(28, 16)": 0.7325694561004639, "(30, 0)": 0.7325694561004639, "(30, 16)": 0.7325694561004639}, "r_span": [646, 677], "hallucination_label": 1, "parameter_knowledge_scores": {"layer_0": 0.0009581446647644043}}]}, {"id": "17235", "source_id": "12364", "model": "llama-2-7b-chat", "temperature": 1.0, "labels": [], "split": "test", "quality": "good", "response": "Based on the provided passages, here is how you can make ice cream:\n\nPassage 1 provides instructions for making ice cream using an ice cream maker. To make ice cream, pour cold ice cream mix into the ice cream maker, turn on the machine, and churn according to the manufacturer's directions (usually 20-25 minutes). Once the ice cream is softly frozen, you can serve it immediately or place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the ice cream and place it in the freezer for 2-3 hours to ripen.\n\nPassage 2 provides a recipe for making ice cream from scratch. To make ice cream, stir sugar, cream, and milk together in a saucepan over low heat until the sugar has dissolved. Then, heat the mixture until a small ring of foam appears around the edges. Transfer the mixture to a pourable container such as a large measuring cup and stir in vanilla extract. Chill the mixture thoroughly for at least 2 hours before serving.\n\nPassage 3 provides general instructions for making ice cream bases. To make ice cream, you will need to start with a good vanilla ice cream base. This type of base is made with cream rather than custard, and it results in a lighter and less icy texture. To make one quart of ice cream, you will need to double the recipe.\n\nTherefore, to summarize:\n\nTo make ice cream using an ice cream maker:\n\n1. Pour cold ice cream mix into the ice cream maker and turn on the machine.\n2. Churn the ice cream according to the manufacturer's directions (usually 20-25 minutes).\n3.

Message size: MMS messages can have a larger size limit of up to 300 KB, while SMS messages are limited to 160 characters or less.\n3. Capability to send multimedia content: MMS supports sending multimedia content, while SMS only allows text messages.\n4.
